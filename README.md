About me 👋
👋 Hello! My name is Carlos Malcher 👨‍💻

🌟 I started my journey as a programmer in February 2024 when I joined the Analysis and Systems Development course at UNAMA Santarém 🌟

🔭 Currently, I'm focusing on learning Java Script, HTML, and CSS

🌱 I'm always seeking more knowledge and don't plan to focus on just one project
